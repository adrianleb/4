          In fact, the world seems to have changed drastically since we last met

          Central-bank-issued fiat currencies devalue faster every year, with
          annual inflation rates of supposedly stable currencies like EUR or USD
          hitting new highs each month. Over the last two years, the global
          crackdown on privacy, freedom of movement, and the right to transact
          by governments worldwide put us on the edge of a new dark age of
          regression.

          We are seriously concerned about the state of the world, but equally
          so about the state of the blockchain space. While we are absolutely
          over the moon for the ever-growing mainstream adoption of
          cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology, certain developments leave
          a bitter aftertaste, and we fear that the most essential values are
          about to get lost along the way. We take this as a call to action and
          want to do our part

          With ETHBerlin³, we aim to go back to the roots and remind our
          community what it's all about: We want to invite you to Berlin to hack
          the system, now more than ever. We want to emphasize the original
          cypherpunk vision and build on it. In addition, we aim to teach and
          educate a new generation of hackers about what you can achieve with
          cryptography, blockchain, and peer-to-peer network technologies.

            "We must defend our own privacy if we expect to have any. We must
            come together and create systems which allow anonymous transactions
            to take place. People have been defending their own privacy for
            centuries with whispers, darkness, envelopes, closed doors, secret
            handshakes, and couriers. The technologies of the past did not allow
            for strong privacy, but electronic technologies do."

          Our big question for you is: How do we get from yield farming fruit
          tokens, VC chains, making the rich richer and a never-ending race to
          the top to an open and an inclusive system that makes a difference in
          people's lives? Which anarchist and privacy-preserving tools can we
          build that enable independence from governments and mega corps?
        </p>

          We will encourage hackathon tracks, workshops, and supporters at
          ETHBerlin³ to focus on the following key aspects:
        </p>

        <ul className="ml-8 my-4">
          <li>Private: there is no need for your name, data, or ID.</li>
          <li>Usable: it has to be accessible and user-friendly.</li>
          <li>Direct: it does not ask for permission.</li>
          <li>
            Subversive: it transforms established orders and structures of
            power.
          </li>
          <li>
            Social: it empowers people and makes a difference in somebody's
            life.
          </li>
          <li>Clandestine: it will not comply.</li>
          <li>Independent: it will not rely on governments or corporates.</li>
          <li>Impactful: it intends to make a difference.</li>
          <li>Secure: it does not put anyone at risk.</li>
          <li>Libre: it will be free both as in free speech and free beer.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Berlin has a dark history of financial scandals, hyperinflation, and
          bank runs. Since inflation is again about to eat the world, we'd like
          to use this as a reminder that the system we live in is not
          infallible, and it's up to us to progress towards change. The fiat
          currencies we use every day are hardly backed by anything at this
          point (money printer goes brrr); we just choose to believe in one
          thing over another. We can choose to build the (financial) future we
          want to live in; nothing really hinders us!
        </p>
        <p>
          In the previous years, ETHBerlin always tried to make a difference by
          pioneering the use of decentralized technologies and nurturing the
          ecosystem. Significant projects emerged from our hackathons, such as{" "}
          <a href="https://www.pinata.cloud/">IPFS Pinata</a> or the{" "}
          <a href="https://goerli.net/">Goerli Testnet</a>. And legend has it
          that even the Dune Analytics founders{" "}
          <a href="https://dune.com/blog/money-aint-a-thang">
            started their career
          </a>{" "}
          at ETHBerlin.
