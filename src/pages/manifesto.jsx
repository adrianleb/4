            The situation is dire. We have been operating in crisis mode for
            years now. Established systems are failing, new and old imperialist
            powers are throwing continents into wars of attrition, global supply
            chains are collapsing, financial markets are tumbling, healthcare
            systems are falling apart, education is on a consistent downward
            spiral — the list goes on.
          </p>
          <p>
            But there is hope: The soils to grow new ideas have never been more
            nutritious. It has never been more urgent to double down on new
            revolutionary concepts and ideas. It is high time to change the
            world.{" "}

          <p>
            Reflecting on the decentralized ecosystems — the very systems
            designed to solve some of the underlying problems of the failing
            society — we realize that instead of creating actionable
            alternatives, we seemingly are:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>reinvigorating hierarchical power structures,</li>
            <li>setting questionable incentives,</li>
            <li>recreating existing failures,</li>
            <li>and hence, are more and more part of the problem.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            <strong>
              The blockchain space is going through a multi-dimensional identity
              crisis.
            </strong>
          </p>

          <p>
            Arguably, on a philosophical level, the ecosystem lost its shared
            identity long ago. Do we know what we want to achieve, and are we
            working towards the same thing? What are our shared values? Where
            are the red lines? All seems a blur, and everything goes in the
            always-online, never-stopping economic game machine.

              &quot;The folly was in thinking that, in a system that allows for
              almost anything, people would *not* maximize for their own utility
              over believing in the mission. To be fair though (and I mean this
              very seriously) a lot of us aren't exactly clear on *what* the
              mission is. It seems like it's mainly a lot of people trading
              shitcoins and jpegs, but we're told this isn't what we're trying
              to do.&quot;

            The lack of shared vision or values also results in an identity
            crisis in the truest sense of the word: How do we deal with
            identities in decentralized communities? Are personhood
            verification, KYC, and AML necessary evils? Or are they the hill we
            are going to die on?

            And again, instead of creating solid alternatives, we seem to be
            part of the problem. We are developing systems with complex social

              &quot;The concept of proof-of-personhood in principle seems very
              valuable [...]. A world with no proof-of-personhood seems more
              likely to be a world dominated by centralized identity solutions,
              money, small closed communities, or some combination of all three.

          </p>
          <p>
            It seems the community is breaking off into different silos: How
            important is privacy? Is something like proof-of-personhood on the
            blockchain a desirable goal, and, how should it be implemented and
            enforced?
          </p>
          <p>
            We want to use our voice in the community to remind everyone that
            privacy should be a core feature of the technologies we are
            building.

          </ul>
          <p>
            We find ourselves at the intersection of decentralization, privacy
            and security research: zero-knowledge cryptography, fully
            homomorphic encryption, secure multi-party computation — the list
            goes on. Let&#39;s put it to use!{" "}

            And, just like last year, we encourage hackers, workshop hosts, and
            supporters at ETHBerlin04 to focus on the following key attributes:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Private</strong>: There is no need for your name, data, or
              ID.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Usable</strong>: It has to be accessible and
              user-friendly.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Direct</strong>: It does not ask for permission.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Subversive</strong>: It transforms established orders and
              structures of power.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Social</strong>: It empowers people and makes a difference
              in somebody&#39;s life.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Clandestine</strong>: It will not comply.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Independent</strong>: It will not rely on governments,
              corporates, or investors.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Impactful</strong>: It intends to make a difference.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Secure</strong>: It does not put anyone at risk.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Libre</strong>: It will be free, both as in free speech
              and free lemonade.
