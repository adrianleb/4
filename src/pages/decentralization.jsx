        ETHBerlin³ is organized by the Department of Decentralization, a
        collective of people from various crypto- and blockchain communities in
        and around Berlin. The group first assembled in 2018 to organize
        ETHBerlin and has been active since.

        Our aim is to be an agnostic vehicle to drive adoption, educate
        newcomers, and raise awareness on the challenges and benefits of
        decentralization and open source software.
